*************************************************

Miniwave is a fixed-width, two column theme
for Moodle 2.

It has a basic settings page with the following
functions:
- Easy setting of theme colour between green &
  red
- Changing the logo, custom title, or auto title
- Adding a footnote
- Removing the link to moodlebites.com in footer
- Custom CSS box

**************** Things to note *****************

Because this is a fixed-width theme, there are
some limitations:
- The custom menu does not wrap well, so you can't
  have more items in there than fit horizontally.
- The navigation bar will cut off at 600 pixels.
- Content items in your course that are wider than
  the content area may cause issues (such as large
  images).

If you downloaded from Moodle.org
- Unzip the compressed file
- Copy the strawberry folder into your Moodle
  theme directory.
- Log into your Moodle site as administrator and
